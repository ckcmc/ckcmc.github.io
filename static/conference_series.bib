  Media Corpora because of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we are very pleased to present the proceedings of the 8th
  edition of the conference (CMC-corpora 2021). This conference series is dedicated to the collection, annotation, processing,
  analysis, and exploitation of corpora of computer-mediated communication and social media for research in the humanities
  and beyond. The annual event brings together language-centred research on CMC and social media in linguistics,
  communication sciences, media studies, and social sciences with research questions from the fields of corpus and
  computational linguistics, language and text technology, and machine learning.},

The contributions in this book cover a wide range of both topics and languages, seen as contributions of different disciplines to the larger scope of digital humanities, as they articulate quantitative and qualitative approaches, formal and computational models, and specific analysis and more general conclusions for humanities.},

The program also includes two invited talks: one keynote talk by Marty Laforest (Universit\'e du Qu\'ebec \`a Trois-Rivi\`eres, Canada), and one by Julien Velcin (University Lumi\`ere Lyon 2). The contributions in these proceedings cover a wide range of both topics and languages. Some contributions focus on standards and best practices of CMC corpora, others on the pragmatics of CMC, others on geographic linguistic variation, or applied linguistics, with discursive, semantic, or computational point of views.},

@book{cmc-corpora:2017:book,
 abstract = {Communication between humans via networked devices has become an everyday part of people's lives across generations, cultures, geographical areas, and social classes. Shaped by the specific social and technical context in which it is produced, synchronous and asynchronous computer-mediated communication (CMC) has become increasingly participatory, interactive, and multimodal. User interactions and user-generated social media content offer a wide range of research opportunities for a growing multidisciplinary research community. This edited volume combines methodological papers that focus on building and annotating CMC corpora and papers that offer a sociolinguistic analysis of different CMC corpora. The diversity of languages represented in the corpora include Arabic, French, German, Italian, English and Slovenian. In fact, the increasingly multilingual nature of CMC data is a recurring theme throughout the volume, as are the references to the importance of and compliance with standards for CMC corpora development in order to facilitate (the?) re-examination of corpora for reproducibility, and for other areas and objectives of investigation. All but one paper are extended papers from the 2017 edition of the CMC and Social Media Corpora Conference held in Bolzano, Italy where the community met to discuss themes that related to the interaction between language, CMC, and society.},

Each submission was reviewed by at least two members of the scientific committee. This committee decided to accept 16 papers and 8 posters of which 14 papers and 3 posters were presented at the conference. The programme also includes three invited talks: two keynote talks by Aivars Glaznieks (Eurac Research, Italy) and A. Seza Do\u{g}ru\"oz (Independent researcher) and an invited talk on the Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure (CLARIN) given by Darja Fi\v{s}er, the CLARIN ERIC Director of User Involvement.},

It includes eight chapters that have been written by 16 authors from 13 different countries and deal with the creation of CMC corpora, and with the analysis of CMC phenomena in 10 different languages. They tackle a diverse range of research questions and use a rich set of approaches, which is why they are organized into four broad thematic and methodological parts: Part 1 - Lexical analysis of CMC, Part 2 - Sociolinguistic analysis of CMC, Part 3 - Conversation and conflict in CMC, and Part 4 - Building and processing CMC resources.},

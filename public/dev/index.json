In Europe alone, more than 30 CMC corpora can be identified and found via a simple web search, for example through their listing in the CLARIN CMC Resource Family1. This development is evidence of a vibrant field of research as well as a general aim towards making existing research resources known. A substantial number of these corpora claim to become or stay available as research data resources for further exploration, replication, or referencing. However, whether research data can be made available and reusable often depends not only on the willingness of the data collector. Especially in the domain of CMC data, a highly debated realm in terms of privacy and data protection, targeted steps are needed to allow for any kind of use or reuse of data for research or dissemination purposes, including the retrieval of user consent, anonymisation, and high-quality processing. Apart from copyright issues and problematic terms of use/terms of service of certain platforms (e.g. Twitter, which does not allow the redistribution of Twitter content), other factors such as data formats, missing long-term preservation strategies, (lack of) persistent identifiers, access protocols or lacking documentation may prevent or at least hamper the dissemination and accessibility of CMC corpora.\nFAIR Guiding Principles The FAIR Guiding Principles for Data Management and Stewardship, published by Wilkinson et al. (2016), provide a universal framework for data management based on the principles of Findability, Accessibility,Interoperability and Reusability. They have received international support, for example, at the G20 Summit in Hangzhou3, have helped with the establishment of community-standards for research data management (Mons et al., 2017) in various domains (e.g. Boeckhoutet al., 2018) and have been incorpo-rated into relevant funding schemes like Horizon 2020 (European Commission, 2016).\nReferences  Jennifer-Carmen Frey, Alexander König, Egon Stemle, Achille Falaise, Darja Fišer, Harald Lüngen  (2020).

It is meant to define a basic setup that one needs to encode CMC corpora, but which is not in the TEI yet.\nAuthors: Michael Beißwenger, Harald Lüngen, Laura Herzberg, and Ciara R. Wigham.\nThe schema is based on version P5 (3.3.0) of the TEI Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange (henceforth: ‘TEI-P5’) and uses customizations to adapt the models defined in TEI-P5 for the modeling of structural and linguistic peculiarities of CMC genres. The schema takes into consideration previous schema drafts that have been developed by members of the SIG (the \u0026lsquo;DeRiK schema\u0026rsquo; described in Beißwenger et al. 2012, the \u0026lsquo;CoMeRe schema\u0026rsquo; described in Chanier et al. 2014, and the \u0026lsquo;CLARIN-D schema\u0026rsquo; described in Lüngen et al. (2016)) as well as discussions on a core schema at the SIG meeting in Vienna at the TEI conference on 30 September 2016] and a meeting of the SIG core group in Essen on 21 June 2017.\nStatus of the schema This schema and examples shall accompany a TEI feature request to be submitted to the TEI Council by the end of 2019. A rationale for the models included in the schema is given in the ODD and in the articles under #References.\nCharacteristics of the schema: TEI customizations The ODD introduces four types of customizations :\n A new module named \u0026lsquo;cmc\u0026rsquo; is introduced. It is referenced by the new model classe model.divPart.cmc, by the new attribute class att.global.cmc, and by the new element . The new element  is introduced. The new attribute class att.global.cmc is introduced. It defines the new global attribute creation. The existing attribute class att.global has been modified to additionally be a member of att.global.cmc . The class model.divPart.cmc is defined. model.divPart.cmc is a member of model.divPart and serves as a container of the new, CMC-specific element .  In addition to these customizations, we have prepared encoding examples for the genres chat, wiki talk, second life, and twitter, based on existing corpora.\nReferences ","date":1536451200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1605785263,"objectID":"996afa64d68fa986a1714c6f0ac01cb0","permalink":"/dev/ckcmc/docs/tei/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ckcmc/docs/tei/","section":"ckcmc","summary":"Learn how to use CMC-TEI.","tags":null,"title":"CMC-TEI","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1605785263,"objectID":"2e69ba63fd8fc7d0184fcf4a38b89dd1","permalink":"/dev/ckcmc/docs/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ckcmc/docs/","section":"ckcmc","summary":"The page for the CLARIN K(noledge)-Centre Documentation","tags":null,"title":"CLARIN K(nowledge)-Centre Documentation","type":"book"},{"authors":["Jennifer-Carmen Frey","Alexander König","Egon Stemle","Achille Falaise","Darja Fišer","Harald Lüngen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605784458,"objectID":"f41411f1315f280270c6e78b77d9a820","permalink":"/dev/publication/frey-et-al-2020-fair-index-cmc/","publishdate":"2020-11-03T15:57:43.074198Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frey-et-al-2020-fair-index-cmc/","section":"publication","summary":"In this article, we examine the current situation of data dissemination and provision for CMC corpora.

We characterise CMC discourse as dialogic, sequentially organised interchange between humans and point out that many features of CMC are not adequately handled by current corpus encoding schemas and tools. We formulate desiderata for a representation of CMC in encoding schemes and argue why the TEI is a suitable framework for the encoding of CMC corpora. We propose a model of basic CMC units (utterances, posts, and nonverbal activities) and the macro- and micro-level structures of interactions in CMC environments. Based on these models, we introduce CMC-core, a TEI customisation for the encoding of CMC corpora, which defines CMC-specific encoding features on the four levels of elements, model classes, attribute classes, and modules of the TEI infrastructure. The description of our customisation is illustrated by encoding examples from corpora by researchers of the TEI SIG CMC, representing a variety of CMC genres, i.e. chat, wiki talk, twitter, blog, and Second Life interactions.

Shaped by the specific social and technical context in which it is produced, synchronous and asynchronous computer-mediated communication (CMC) has become increasingly participatory, interactive, and multimodal. User interactions and user-generated social media content offer a wide range of research opportunities for a growing multidisciplinary research community. This edited volume combines methodological papers that focus on building and annotating CMC corpora and papers that offer a sociolinguistic analysis of different CMC corpora. The diversity of languages represented in the corpora include Arabic, French, German, Italian, English and Slovenian. In fact, the increasingly multilingual nature of CMC data is a recurring theme throughout the volume, as are the references to the importance of and compliance with standards for CMC corpora development in order to facilitate (the?) re-examination of corpora for reproducibility, and for other areas and objectives of investigation. All but one paper are extended papers from the 2017 edition of the CMC and Social Media Corpora Conference held in Bolzano, Italy where the community met to discuss themes that related to the interaction between language, CMC, and society.","tags":[],"title":"Building Computer-Mediated Communication Corpora for sociolinguistic Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Reinhild Vandekerckhove","Darja Fišer","Lisa Hilte"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605784343,"objectID":"e76141800fcff768b26d1f604a59d808","permalink":"/dev/publication/cmc-corpora-2018/","publishdate":"2020-10-30T09:09:28.497561Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cmc-corpora-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Proceedings of the 6th Conference on Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) and Social Media Corpora (CMC-corpora 2018), 17-18 September 2018, University of Antwerp","tags":["cmc-corpora conference proceeding"],"title":"Proceedings of the 6th Conference on Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) and Social Media (CMC-corpora 2018)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The 5th conference on CMC and Social Media Corpora for the Humanities was held in Bolzano/Bozen, Italy on 3-4 October 2017 and focused on the collection, analysis and processing of mono and multimodal, synchronous and asynchronous communications.

In contrast, one-stage detectors that are applied over a regular, dense sampling of possible object locations have the potential to be faster and simpler, but have trailed the accuracy of two-stage detectors thus far. In this paper, we investigate why this is the case. We discover that the extreme foreground-background class imbalance encountered during training of dense detectors is the central cause. We propose to address this class imbalance by reshaping the standard cross entropy loss such that it down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples. Our novel Focal Loss focuses training on a sparse set of hard examples and prevents the vast number of easy negatives from overwhelming the detector during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our loss, we design and train a simple dense detector we call RetinaNet. Our results show that when trained with the focal loss, RetinaNet is able to match the speed of previous one-stage detectors while surpassing the accuracy of all existing state-of-the-art two-stage detectors.

Send a short exposé which covers the scientific part of the event, as well as details of the local organization – see hereafter – and a provisional budget.\nEach conference is organized by local organizers in cooperation with the steering committee. cmc-corpora conferences are announced via the cmc-corpora mailing list, the cmc-corpora Facebook page and other mailing lists \u0026amp; networks with a call for papers at least six (better: eight) months in advance. Papers are submitted for the conference via an online submission system (e.g., EasyChair, ConfTool) which is administered by the local organizers.\nThe scientific committee has a chair which is composed equally of representatives of the steering committee and representatives of the local organizers (1:1 or 2:2).\nThe other members of the scientific committee are chosen cooperatively by the scientific chairs. It should comprise 10 people at minimum and – for continuity\u0026rsquo;s sake – include people from the scientific comitee of previous conferences of the series.\nThe conference language is English. All submissions are peer-reviewed independently by two members of the scientific committee. Reviews are assigned to reviewers by the scientific chairs.\nThe scientific chairs make sure that submissions accepted for the conference as result of the review process represent projects from different countries and on CMC and social media discourse in different languages.\nEach conference has a volume of proceedings which is made available online together with the conference and which includes all submissions which have been accepted for the conference. The proceedings are openly accessible. The local organizers make sure that the proceedings remain accessible persistently.\nIt is expected that the organizing institution is able to finance travel and accomodation for one international keynote speaker. A cmccorpora conference typically has two keynote talks given by one local keynote speaker (= from the country where the conference takes place) and one international speaker.\nBesides the scientific comitee there is an organization committee with members nominated by the local organizers.\nRoadmap for organizing the conference:\n  The local organizers report to the steering committee early in advance about their plans for local organization (venue, program structure, accommodation) in the format of a concise exposé (An example for an exposé of a previous conference is attached). Open issues will be discussed with the steering committee via skype or email. The exposé should include suggestions for a conference date (or dates) which fit for the local organizers and their institution.\n  After (1) is finished, the steering committee and the local organizers cooperatively nominate the scientific chairs for the conference and define dates and formats for submission, reviewing, notifications, and for the publication of the online proceedings.\n  The scientific chairs create a call for papers for the conference.\n  The local organizers set up a conference website with the call for papers, important dates, the list of committee members and at least preliminary local information (venue, travel, etc.) which may later be expanded.\n  The steering committee is involved as a partner in general aspects of planning the conference while the main responsibility for the overall organization of the event is with the local organizers and the responsibility for the scientific organization is with the scientific chairs.\nFurther aspects which the local organizers may wish to address in the exposé:\n  The program \u0026amp; schedule of the conference is made available on the conference website as early in advance as possible.\n  Up-to-date technical equipment in the conference venue (beamer, computer for presentation, enough room for the expected number of participants).\n  Each session for the conference should have a session chair (e.g., members of the scientific and of the organization committee).\n  If different sessions in the conference are scheduled for different rooms, it should be always clear for the participants during the conference where to find the room of their choice, and participants should have time to switch from one room to the other.\n  In the conference breaks, a coffee bar with at least coffee, tea and non-alcoholic drinks should be provided. If there\u0026rsquo;s no option for getting the coffee bar funded by a third party, it is acceptable to include costs for coffee breaks in the general conference fee, or to ask the participants to pay a lump sum for coffee bar \u0026amp; refreshments which covers the expenses of the organizers.\n  For lunch breaks, the local organizers make suggestions where participants could go for lunch (or organize to have lunch with the whole group). Participants pay the lunch by themselves except that the local organizers should have funding to invite them.\n  The conference should include a social event (e.g. a conference dinner) which is organized by the local organizers. We recommend to let participants decide if they wish to attend the social event together with the (online) registration. Costs for the social event should not be included in the general conference fee but be only paid by those participants who decided to attend it.\n  On the conference website, the local organizers provide travel directions for the participants considering different means of transportation.\n  The publication of a monograph with follow-up proceedings is encouraged (but not compulsory) to preserve the major outcomes of the conference for the scientific community. Whereas the online proceedings which are published together with the conference include the short papers submitted for the conference, the follow-up allows authors to present their contributions in the form of full papers. If a follow-up book is planned we strongly recommend to publish it as open access. For the follow-up book, there should be a separate call for papers which is published after the conference. The scientific chair of the conference decides about the call for papers. The call may also address people who have not presented a paper at the conference.\n  Get in touch: contact @ cmc-corpora.org (without spaces)\n","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605785087,"objectID":"920499f52996c22d720ea8a4ce5b0a77","permalink":"/dev/post/organizing-a-cmc-corpora-event/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/organizing-a-cmc-corpora-event/","section":"post","summary":"Instructions on how to organize a cmc-corpora event.","tags":[],"title":"Organizing a cmc-corpora event","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605785087,"objectID":"782bdc740c32b29cc19c01e80458f3f9","permalink":"/dev/series/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/series/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605785263,"objectID":"087e701d1e6c27c8065a4be5b42754be","permalink":"/dev/ckcmc/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ckcmc/","section":"ckcmc","summary":"The page for the CLARIN K(noledge)-Centre","tags":null,"title":"CLARIN K(nowledge)-Centre","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Egon W.

computer-mediated communication (CMC) and social media for research in the
humanities. The conference brought together language-centered research on CMC
and social media in linguistics, philologies, communication sciences, media and
social sciences with research questions from the fields of corpus and
computational linguistics, language technology, text technology, and machine

&lt;p>The 6th conference on CMC and Social Media Corpora was held in Antwerp,
Belgium on 17-18 September 2018. It was hosted by the &lt;a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/clips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CLiPS research center
(Computational Linguistics and
Psycholinguistics)&lt;/a> at the
University of Antwerp.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CMC-Corpora 2017: 5th Conference on CMC and Social Media Corpora for the Humanities</title><link>/dev/conferences/cmc-corpora2017/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dev/conferences/cmc-corpora2017/</guid><description>&lt;p>The 5th conference on CMC and Social Media Corpora for the Humanities was
held in Bolzano/Bozen, Italy on 3-4 October 2017 and focused on the
collection, analysis and processing of mono and multimodal, synchronous and
asynchronous communications. The focus encompassed different CMC genres.
These included, but were not limited to, discussion forums, blogs, newsgroups,
emails, SMS and WhatsApp, text chats, wiki discussions, social network
exchanges (such as Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin), discussions in multimodal
and/or 3D environments (virtual worlds, gaming worlds).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The conference brought together researchers with interests in the
collection, organization, processing, analysis and sharing of CMC data for
research purposes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The conference was hosted by Eurac Research and included a post-conference
workshop on using the TEI for annotating CMC and social media resources (4
October 2017). It was followed by the 4th Learner Corpus Research Conference and
its preceding conference workshop, which were held at the same venue
from 4-7 October 2017.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CMC-Corpora 2016: 4th Conference on CMC and Social Media Corpora for the Humanities</title><link>/dev/conferences/cmc-corpora2016/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dev/conferences/cmc-corpora2016/</guid><description>&lt;p>CMC and Social Media Corpora for the Humanities was the 4th edition of an annual

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>research in which computational methods and tools are used for the empirical
analysis of CMC in the humanities;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>approaches towards automatic processing and annotation of CMC data with
computational methods; and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>corpus-linguistic research on collecting, processing, representing and
providing CMC corpora on the basis of standards in the field of the digital
humanities.&lt;/li>

## Introduction

The last few years have brought forward a significant amount of language
corpora  dedicated  to  computer-mediated  communication (CMC). In Europe
alone, more than 30 CMC corpora can be identified and found via a simple web
search, for example through their listing in  the  CLARIN  CMC  Resource
Family1.  This  development  is evidence of a vibrant field of research as well
as a general aim towards making existing research resources known. A
substantial number of these  corpora  claim  to  become  or  stay  available
as  research  data resources  for  further  exploration,  replication,  or
referencing. However, whether research data can be made available and reusable
often  depends  not  only  on  the  willingness  of  the  data  collector.
Especially in the domain of CMC data, a highly debated realm in terms of
privacy and data protection, targeted steps are needed to allow for any kind of
use or reuse of data for research or dissemination purposes, including  the
retrieval  of  user  consent,  anonymisation,  and  high-quality processing.
Apart from copyright issues and problematic terms of use/terms of service of
certain platforms (e.g. Twitter, which does not allow the redistribution of
Twitter content), other factors such as data  formats,  missing  long-term
preservation  strategies,  (lack  of) persistent identifiers, access protocols
or lacking documentation may prevent or at least hamper the dissemination and
accessibility of CMC corpora.

## FAIR Guiding Principles

The  FAIR  Guiding  Principles  for  Data  Management  and Stewardship,
published by Wilkinson et al. (2016), provide a universal framework  for  data
management  based  on  the  principles  of Findability,
Accessibility,Interoperability and Reusability. They have received
international  support,  for  example,  at  the  G20  Summit  in Hangzhou3,
have  helped  with  the  establishment  of  community-standards for research
data management (Mons et al., 2017) in various domains (e.g. Boeckhoutet al.,
2018) and have been incorpo-rated into relevant funding schemes like Horizon
2020 (European Commission, 2016).

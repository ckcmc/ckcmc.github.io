We offer expertise on language resources and technologies for Computer-Mediated
Communication and Social Media.  We can be contacted via [email to `helpdesk @
THIS DOMAIN`](mailto:{{< param helpdesk_email >}}).  There, we offer additional
clarifications regarding this documentation and support in using, modifying,
producing, or publishing CMC resources and technologies.  For more general
questions, also consider joining the [European group of researchers interested
in the development and processing of CMC corpora @ Google
Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=de#!forum/cmc-corpora).

As we are a young K-Centre, our documentation is still under development.  Once
we have collected enough input, we will be adding a FAQ section with your most
pressing questions.  We are also interested in your thoughts on missing or
wrong information.

In the meantime, we have already started to summarise important information for
the two central topics of our K-Centre:
* [FAIR]({{< relref "/ckcmc/docs/fair/" >}}) best practices when creating a new CMC corpus
* [CMC-TEI]({{< relref "/ckcmc/docs/tei/" >}}) about a TEI standard for the representation of
  the structural and linguistic peculiarities of CMC

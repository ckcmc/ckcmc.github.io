=Presentation=

[The Leibniz-Institut for the German Language (IDS)](https://www1.ids-mannheim.de) is the central non-university institution for the study and documentation of the contemporary usage and recent history of the German language. Together with more than 90 research and service institutions, it is a member of the Leibniz Association, one of the four major research organizations in Germany. 

In its four research departments (Grammar, Lexis, Pragmatics, and Digital Linguistics), the IDS pursues mostly long-term projects which require larger research teams. Within a number of research projects, the IDS cooperates with project teams and individual researchers at universitites.

Its library, archives, documentations, digital corpora and language repositories are available to external researchers as well. With its lecture events, conferences and colloquia, the IDS is also a place of academic encounter and communication for researchers in German studies from Germany and abroad and all those interested in language.

=Academic Status and History=

The IDS was founded in 1964. As a member of the Leibniz Association, the Institute is financed jointly by the Federal Government and the state of Baden-W端rttemberg. Various additional funding is provided by research-promotion organizations such as the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Community for the Promotion of Research) and the Volkswagen-Stiftung (Volkswagen Foundation). Support is also provided by the city of Mannheim and the Verein der Freunde des Instituts f端r Deutsche Sprache e.V. (Association of the Friends of the Institute for the German Language - registered association). At present, the IDS has 227 employees including 105 researchers.

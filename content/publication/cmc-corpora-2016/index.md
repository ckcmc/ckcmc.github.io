abstract: '
This volume presents the proceedings of the 4th edition of the Conference on
CMC and Social Media Corpora for the Humanities (cmc-corpora2016) which was
held on September 27–28 at the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. The
conference series (http://cmc-corpora.org/) is dedicated to the collection,
organization, annotation, processing, analysis and sharing of data and corpora
from computer-mediated communication (CMC) and social media genres for research
purposes. The genres of interest to the cmc-corpora conference community
include e-mail, chats, forums, newsgroups, blogs, news comments, wiki
discussions, SMS and mobile messaging applications (WhatsApp, etc.),
interactions on social network sites (Facebook, Twitter etc.), on YouTube and
in multimodal online environments. The conference brings together research
questions from linguistics, philology, communication sciences, media and social
sciences with methods, tools and infrastructures from the fields of corpus and
computational linguistics, natural language processing, text technology and
digital humanities. The focus of the conferences is on

* language-centered  research  using  computational  methods and  tools  for
  the empirical analysis of CMC and social media phenomena,

* approaches towards automatic processing and annotation of CMC and social
  media data,

* corpus-linguistic research on collecting, processing, representing and
  providing CMC and social media corpora on the basis of standards in the field
  of digital humanities.'

abstract: 'This special issue of the JLCL gathers five contributions of
  scholars and projects who aim to close the “CMC gap” in the corpora landscape
  for several European languages: the French CoMeRe project (Chanier et al.),
  the South Tyrolian DiDi project (Glaznieks & Stemle), the German Wikipedia
  corpus (Margaretha & Lüngen), the Dutch VU Chat corpus (Spooren & van
  Charldorp), and the research on language variation in Dutch Twitter data (van
  Halteren & Oostdijk).'

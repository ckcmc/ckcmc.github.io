abstract: 'This volume presents the proceedings of the 7th edition of the annual conference
  series on CMC and Social Media Corpora for the Humanities (CMC-Corpora2019). This
  conference series is dedicated to the collection, annotation, processing, and exploitation
  of corpora of computer-mediated communication (CMC) and social media for research
  in the humanities. The annual event brings together language-centered research on
  CMC and social media in linguistics, philologies, communication sciences, media
  and social sciences with research questions from the fields of corpus and computational
  linguistics, language technology, text technology, and machine learning. The 7th
  Conference on CMC and Social Media Corpora for the Humanities was held at IDHN (Institute
  of digital humanities) on Septembre, 9th and 10th, in Cergy-Pontoise, France. This
  volume contains extended abstracts of the papers (14), and abstracts of posters
  presented at the event (4). The program also includes two invited talks: one keynote
  talk by Marty Laforest (Université du Qub́ec à Trois-Rivir̀es, Canada), and one
  by Julien Velcin (University Lumi`è Lyon 2). The contributions in these proceedings
  cover a wide range of both topics and languages. Some contributions focus on standards
  and best practices of CMC corpora, others on the pragmatics of CMC, others on geographic
  linguistic variation, or applied linguistics, with discursive, semantic, or computational
  point of views.'

The special interest group "computer-mediated communication" of the Text
Encoding Initiative (TEI) provides schemas for the annotation of cmc and social
media genres which are conformant with the TEI standards for text encoding and
which have been tested in corpus projects on French and German CMC.

The schemas have been presented and discussed as part of the [2015 cmc-corpora
conference in Rennes, France]({{< relref "cmc-corpora2015" >}}).

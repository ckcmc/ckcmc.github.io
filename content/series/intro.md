*cmccorpora* (http://cmc-corpora.org) is a series of conferences dedicated to
the collection, annotation, processing and analysis of corpora of
computer-mediated communication (CMC) and social media for research in the
Humanities.

The conferences bring together language-centered research on CMC and social
media in linguistics, philologies, communication sciences, media and social
sciences with research questions from the field of corpus and computational
linguistics, language technology, text technology and machine learning. The
conferences feature 

* research in which computational methods and tools are used for
  language-centered empirical analysis of CMC and social media phenomena in the
  humanities, 

* research on processing and annotation of CMC and social media data with
  approaches from the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text
  Technology, 

* corpus-linguistic research on collecting, processing, representing and
  providing CMC corpora on the basis of standards in the field of the Digital
  Humanities.

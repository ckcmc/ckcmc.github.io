The 8th edition of the Conference on Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) and
Social Media Corpora will take place in Nijmegen, the Netherlands on Thursday
28 - Friday 29 October 2021.

CMC2021 is the 8th edition of an annual conference series dedicated to the
development, analysis, and processing of corpora of computer-mediated
communication (CMC) and social media for research in the humanities. The
conference brings together language-centred research on CMC and social media in
linguistics, communication sciences, media studies, and social sciences with
research questions from the fields of corpus and computational linguistics,
language and text technology, and machine learning. Because of the global
COVID-19 pandemic, the conference will take place in hybrid form: you can
choose to attend online or in person.
